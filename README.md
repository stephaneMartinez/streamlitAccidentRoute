Analyse des accidents de la route entre 2020 et 2022
==============================

This application presents the methodology applied during the execution of our year-end capstone project. The goal of the project is to analyze road accidents that occurred in France between 2020 and 2022, identify particularly accident-prone areas, aggravating factors, and propose models that can predict the risk of having a serious accident.
